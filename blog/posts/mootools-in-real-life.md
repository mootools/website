If you've been paying attention for the past few years, you've probably noticed the growth of MooTools, both as a project and as a thriving community.  Unfortunately, it has come to light that many so called "members" of the JavaScript community may, in fact, be automata.

To protect ourselves and the MooTools community, we've started two physical screening programs (or "meetups"), one in London and the other in the heart of Silicon Valley.

In a surprising turn of events, both groups have had very informative meetings in which *actual people* have shown up, allowing us to conclusively state that at least some of the members of the MooTools community are, in fact, human.  Insightful discussions were had by all, new users and advanced developers alike.

If you're in the Bay Area or London, it is imperative that you attend at least one of our screening sessions, to verify yourself as human.  To be notified about future meetups, as well as voice your opinion on when/where they should be, you can join the Meetup.com group for your area:

* [MooTools London](http://www.meetup.com/MooToolsLondon/)
* [MooTools Bay Area](http://www.meetup.com/MooToolsBayArea/)

<h3>Anything Interesting to Share?</h3>

If you have something insightful and MooTools-related to share, and think you can spin it into a fifteen minute presentation, please let us know.

Right now, we don't have any formal communication set up, but it shouldn't be to hard to get in touch with either Darren (London) or myself (Bay Area).  Contact information can be found on [the developers page](/developers).

Thanks for using MooTools, and we hope to see you there!
