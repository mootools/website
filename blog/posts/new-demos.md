We've been beavering away here in MooTools Towers looking though our <a href="/blog/2010/12/05/mootools-survey/">recent survey</a> results (more feedback coming soon) and one of the things that was obvious you guys and gals wanted was new demos.

So! Check out <a href="/demos">our new demos</a>. We hope you like them!

We're also delighted to be able to include full <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsFiddle</a> support, so you can easily view, edit and generally play with our new demos easily!

The entire demo runner is also available on our <a href="https://github.com/mootools/mootools-demos">GitHub repository</a>; so if you can run PHP it should be super-simple for you to get them up and running.

Do you have any demos you think we should add? Let us know in the comments! Or, fork it, and send us a pull request :)

We love our new demos and hope you do too!
