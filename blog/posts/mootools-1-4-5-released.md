__MooTools Core 1.4.5__ is a maintenance release for the 1.4 branch.

1.4.5 brings a critical bugfix for `Fx.CSS` which caused many troubles for tweening and morphing your element styles. The bug was caused by a fix in 1.4.4 which should improve animating other length units like `%` or `em` (see [#2160](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/issues/2160). Many of you noticed the bug and filled bugreports and also helped us testing this new release.

We have improved our tests and are planning to freeze the code for a new release for a longer period so we can gather more feedback to prevent potential regressions. If you're interested in testing a new release in your application, you can ping us on IRC (#mootools on freenode.net), Twitter ([@mootools](http://twitter.com/mootools) / [@astolwijk](http://twitter.com/astolwijk)) or in the [MooTools User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mootools-users).
