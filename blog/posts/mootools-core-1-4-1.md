Today we release MooTools Core 1.4.1 which is a small maintenance release and as such only fixes bugs that were introduced in previous releases. We have fixed the `mousewheel` event in Firefox, `Element.fade` sets the `visibility` CSS-property again, Event.Delegation now behaves properly if you use `fireEvent` and we have fixed a couple of issues with `Element.setProperty` and `Element.removeProperty`.

Upgrading from 1.4.0 should not cause any backward incompatibilities. We recommend all users to update to 1.4.1 as soon as possible.
