Last month we held the [MooTools User's Survey](http://mootools.net/blog/2010/12/05/mootools-survey) and we would like to thank you all for participating and sharing your ideas. We received more than 700 submissions!  Here is a summary of the results and our thoughts about them.

### Core

Most of you think MooTools Core is fine as it is, with an obvious exception: Swiff has to go. This change has already been planned for the next major release. There are several good ideas about what we could add to Core: element shortcuts (`.hide()` and `.show()`, for example), a few Types from MooTools More, Event Delegation, Pseudo Events, and [cowbells](http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/1558/PreviewComp/SuperStock_1558-09213.jpg)! In short, we would like to keep MooTools Core a compact, modular, object oriented framework. Specific UI plugins, for instance, would be a better fit for MooTools More or maybe the Forge.

### More

Many of you supplement MooTools Core with MooTools More (96%) but are also equally divided whether More should contain UI plugins or if those should be in the Forge. Most of you (60%) like to see more abstraction APIs, such as enhancements to Core. That’s probably why Types and Drag are the most popular More components. HtmlTable is the biggest candidate for removal (43%) followed by Accordion (34%) (ndVP: yey!). In general, you had many ideas about what to add to MooTools More, such as specific UI plugins, support for HTML5 features, geolocation, and storage.

### Forge

The Forge is pretty popular, about 65% of respondents use the Forge to a find plugin. About 11% have contributed to the Forge with new plugins. Respondents shared great ideas for improving the Forge, including: comments, ratings, better search, featured plugins or a combined (packager-web) download page which selects all dependencies.

### API Documentation

A very important part of MooTools is the online API documentation. Most of you think they are pretty good, but are also put off by the lacks of examples. We’ve heard you and that’s why we responded with our [fancy new demos](http://mootools.net/demos) which we [released](http://mootools.net/blog/2011/01/04/new-demos) a few weeks ago! Our plan is to add new demos which we will use as additions to the docs. You will find links from the docs to the demos, which you can play with thanks to the [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) integration. We don’t have demos of each part of Core or More yet, so if you want to help, you can fork the [repository](http://github.com/mootools/mootools-demos) and add new ones, or just ping us ([@astolwijk](http://www.twitter.com/astolwijk) or [@fakedarren](http://www.twitter.com/fakedarren)) with new jsfiddles. Another popular idea that we particularly liked is the addition of a comment system to the API documentation.

I’d like to point out that you can easily start hacking on the docs if you feel so inclined. Just make sure you have a github account, fork [mootools-core](http://www.github.com/mootools/mootools-core) or [mootools-more](http://www.github.com/mootools/mootools-more), browse to the Docs folder and select a .md file. Github has awesome online editing features, so you can work without knowing anything about GIT! If you modify a file we will see it via the network view and will include your fix into the main repository.


### Upgrade to MooTools 1.3

We are really happy to see that the release of MooTools 1.3 went smoothly and most of you are already in love with the new MooTools. One point for improvement would be to put the [upgrade](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/wiki/Upgrade-from-1.2-to-1.3) tutorials on the wiki in a more prominent place on the mootools.net website.

### The lucky winner of the T-Shirt

Congratulations to the lucky winner of the awesome MooTools t-shirt. You’ll receive it shortly, and we sincerely hope you’ll wear it with pride!

In conclusion, thanks for all the *"MooTools FTW!"* responses, the cowbells suggestions, and other great feedback you guys sent us. We <3 you.
