<p>The foundation of every great open source project is its community. The MooTools Team creates the base framework code but it’s all of you that take the framework and build outstanding plugins. These are just some of the new developments floating around the MooTools community.</p>

<h3>12 Steps to MooTools Mastery</h3>
<p>Jacob Thornton's NetTuts article, 12 Steps to MooTools Master, is a high-level introduction to the MooTools JavaScript framework.  The informative article touches on such MooTools topics as Mutators, Prototypal Inheritance, custom events, binding, and more.  This tutorial probably isn't for the complete beginner, but is a good place to start for people still relatively new to MooTools and those considering it for the first time.</p>
