This year we're thinking about getting everyone in the MooTools community together, in one place, for a weekend to meet up, chat, discuss, and have an all-around good time. That's right, we're trying to plan a MooTools Conference!

But before we can do that, we need your help. We've set up a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1idslnn9d1_F4GvXowzA9m2fPrupXzTbCOvn7N-5r-y0/viewform) so we can gauge interest in a MooTools Conference. All you need to do is take a minute and answer the questions.

We'll keep the form up until next week, but make sure you answer quickly so we can start planning this awesome Official MooTools Gathering (or OMG--which might or might not be the name of the conference).
