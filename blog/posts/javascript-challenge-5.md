The other day I was playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)">Fez</a> when I was reminded of an old memory game I used to play where a sequence of colours are shown and the player has to repeat the sequence correctly to proceed. Players are shown increasingly long sequences or colours, stretching their memory to its limits!

This week’s challenge will be to create a memory game using shapes, colours, numbers or anything really, so long as it involves memory. Refer to the following diagram...

<div style="padding-bottom: 1em"><img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/post6.png" alt="" width="350" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1798" /></div>

The basic idea is that your game should present a series of colours, shapes, numbers, etc. for the user to then repeat. If they get the sequence right, the next level starts, which increases in difficulty.

Hint: you should store the order of the sequence so that it can be reused when checking the user’s input. Make things interesting by allowing keyboard navigation, or varying the elements used from level to level.

You can make your solutions as intricate or as basic as you wish!

As before; post your solutions in the form of links to <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a>, <a href="http://tinker.io/">tinker</a> or <a href="http://jsbin.com/">jsbin</a> (in the comment section) and we’ll update this post with the solutions that we think tackle the problem in ways worthy of mention.

Happy coding!
