Today we enabled Bountysource for [MooTools Core](https://www.bountysource.com/#trackers/22067-mootools-mootools-core) and [MooTools More](https://www.bountysource.com/#trackers/22069-mootools-mootools-more). Bountysource is a funding platform for Open Source projects like MooTools.

It works as follows: there is an issue on GitHub. You, or anyone else, can create a bounty to back the issue. Then some developer (either a MooTools Team Member or some other contributor) fixes the issue. Once it gets merged and he or she can collect the bounty!

We think this could help to prioritize issues and to increase community contributions. After all, who doesn't like to get some pocket money to buy a beer or [MooTools t-shirt](http://mootools.net/merch)!
