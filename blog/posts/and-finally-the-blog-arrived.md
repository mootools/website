After more than a year of continuous and dedicated development, [we](/developers) decided it was time to launch a blog to keep you in the loop.

Here we're gonna post about the latest moo trends, the latest breaking changes, the latest plugins that see the light everyday.

Hoping its enough for an introductory post, I'll leave you at better things, for now.

Cheers

Valerio
