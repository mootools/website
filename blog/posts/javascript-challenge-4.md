Back in the old days, there was an operating system named after transparent, glass-filled wall apertures numbering in mid-90’s. This operating system was designed to run on computers with CRT screens, which actually needed software to upset the patterns of light they generated, called screensavers.

This operating system had just such software, in a number of different variations. One of these created the “illusion” that the observer was travelling through space, passing stars. This is the subject of this week’s challenge.

Refer to the following diagram...

<div style="padding-bottom: 1em"><img src="http://mootools.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/8746c5e9fa690a0f8bec719949631537fd6d_1stars_med_362x272.jpeg" alt="" width="362" height="272" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1778" /></div>

...not very helpful.

The idea is that “stars” appear in the center and move to the bounds of the viewport. However you choose to create this effect is up to you.

Hint: you can achieve the effect using elements, canvas or SVG but so long as they move outward you are on the right track. What we’re interested in is how efficiently this can be coded and how little yours leaks! Try spicing things up by adding interactivity or variation of any description.

You can make your solutions as intricate or as basic as you wish!

As before; post your solutions in the form of links to <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a>, <a href="http://tinker.io/">tinker</a> or <a href="http://jsbin.com/">jsbin</a> (in the comment section) and we’ll update this post with a link to a review post detailing solutions that we think tackle the problem in ways worthy of mention.

Good luck!

<strong>EDIT [2012/08/22]</strong>: We are closing comments and reviewing submissions. We will follow this post up with a review of our favourites and what they teach us about the task and JavaScript development in general.
