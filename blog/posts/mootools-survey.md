The community and the MooTools users are very important for MooTools and its development. Therefore we would love to hear who you are and how you are using MooTools. You could do this by this [survey][survey link]. It will take about five minutes and none of the questions are required.

The purpose of this survey is to help us prioritize what the development team spends its time on. We want to make MooTools as useful for you as we can. Some questions are more explicit than others, relating to where we put things or what features we should focus on more or less. Armed with this information we can dedicate our resources to the things that matter most to you.

Because we think your opinion is valuable, we'll be giving something in return. You can win a **MooTools™ Shirt**. Maybe you will look just as awesome as Tim soon!

The survey will be open for two or three weeks. After that time we will compile some sort of conclusion from the results and share it with you. 

So head over to the [survey][survey link] and let your opinion count!
